## About Me
Hello everyone, I am korax. I am a Computer Science Student and aspire to be a software developer. I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@_korax_">YouTube Channel</a> where I share various tips to help people with different technologies. I also showcase new products and software I come across, talk about my experiences with tech and play games on my channel too (soon :P).

## About this Website
This website is a general landing page where you can find my projects as well as tutorials and other write-ups. Currently this site is a W.I.P. so there aren't much things here, however in the mean time, you can keep an eye on the <a href="/posts/index.html">Posts section</a> or check existing stuff on my <a href="https://github.com/koraxial">GitHub</a>.
