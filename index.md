## About Me
Hello everyone, I am korax. I am a Computer Science Student and I aspire to be a software developer someday. 
I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@_korax_">YouTube Channel</a> where I share tips on various technical topics, showcase new products and software I come across, talk about my experiences with tech and play games too (soon :P).

## About this Website
This website is a general landing page where you can find my projects as well as tutorials and other write-ups. Presently, due to limited availability of time there aren't much things here. 
However, you can keep an eye on the <a href="/grouped">Posts Section</a> for updates or check existing stuff on my <a href="https://github.com/koraxial">GitHub</a>. 

## Support
As of now, all my <a href="/socials">socials</a> are linked here, if you want to show your support you can watch some videos on my channel or check my repositories. 
Just a few kind words are enough for me.
